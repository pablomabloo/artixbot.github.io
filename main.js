West is a rapper, singer, record producer, entrepreneur, politician, and fashion designer from the United States. You might've pointed out how he's a politician, he ran for presidency in 2020. Although he accumulated low numbers drastically compared to the other politicians, he showed that he is a versatile in his roles in throughtout his lifetime.
